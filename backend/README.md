# Gym Management System

## Overview

The **Gym Management System** is an advanced web application designed to manage the operations of a gym facility. It facilitates the management of Member, trainers, workout plans, schedules, payments, equipment, and more. The application is built using **Spring Boot** for the backend and **MySQL** for the database. Future plans include integrating a ReactJS frontend and expanding to microservices architecture for scalability.

## Features

- **Member Management**: Add, update, and manage gym Member.
- **Trainer Management**: Assign trainers, manage their schedules, and track sessions.
- **Workout Plans**: Assign customized workout plans to Member.
- **Class Management**: Schedule and manage group classes.
- **Payment Tracking**: Manage payments for Memberships and personal training sessions.
- **Equipment Tracking**: Track gym equipment usage and maintenance.
- **Diet Plans**: Assign and track diet plans for Member.
- **Attendance Tracking**: Monitor attendance for classes and personal training.
- **Inventory Management**: Manage stock and sales of gym supplements and accessories.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Spring Boot, JPA (Hibernate), Spring Security (optional for authentication)
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Frontend**: (Planned) ReactJS
- **Build Tool**: Maven
- **Cloud**: (Future integration) AWS for cloud deployment
- **API Documentation**: Swagger (for easy access to API details)
- **Microservices**: (Planned) Convert core features into microservices for scalability

## Prerequisites

- **Java 17+**
- **Maven 3.8+**
- **MySQL 8+**
- **Node.js** (if using React for the frontend later)
- **Git**

## Database Schema

The database schema includes the following tables:

- `Member`: Stores gym Member’ details.
- `Trainers`: Stores trainers’ information.
- `Memberships`: Links Member to their Membership plans.
- `Workout_Plans`: Custom workout plans for Member.
- `Workout_Sessions`: Tracks Member’ individual workout sessions.
- `Trainer_Schedules`: Trainers’ availability and scheduled appointments.
- `Equipment`: Tracks gym equipment and its maintenance status.
- `Payments`: Manages payment details for Memberships and personal training.
- `Classes`: Stores information about group classes.
- `Class_Enrollments`: Tracks Member enrolled in classes.
- `Attendance`: Tracks attendance for both classes and personal training sessions.
- `Diet_Plans`: Diet plans assigned to Member.
- `Feedback`: Stores member feedback for trainers and services.
- `Staff`: General gym staff Member (e.g., receptionists).
- `Inventory`: Supplements and accessories sold by the gym.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gym-management-system.git
   cd gym-management-system
   ```

2. **Configure the database**:
   - Create a MySQL database named `gym_management`.
   - Update `application.properties` (or `application.yml`) in `src/main/resources` with your MySQL credentials:

     ```properties
     spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/gym_management
     spring.datasource.username=your_username
     spring.datasource.password=your_password
     spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
     spring.jpa.show-sql=true
     ```

3. **Run the application**:

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

4. **API Documentation**:
   Access the API documentation at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html` (if Swagger is configured).

## API Endpoints

Here’s a brief overview of the API endpoints that will be available:

- **Member**:
  - `GET /api/Member`: Get all Member
  - `POST /api/Member`: Add a new member
  - `PUT /api/Member/{id}`: Update a member’s details
  - `DELETE /api/Member/{id}`: Remove a member
  
- **Trainers**:
  - `GET /api/trainers`: Get all trainers
  - `POST /api/trainers`: Add a new trainer
  - `PUT /api/trainers/{id}`: Update a trainer’s details
  - `DELETE /api/trainers/{id}`: Remove a trainer

- **Classes**:
  - `GET /api/classes`: Get all classes
  - `POST /api/classes`: Schedule a new class
  - `PUT /api/classes/{id}`: Update class details
  - `DELETE /api/classes/{id}`: Cancel a class

- **Payments**:
  - `GET /api/payments`: Get payment history
  - `POST /api/payments`: Record a new payment
  - `PUT /api/payments/{id}`: Update payment details

- And many more for workout plans, diet plans, attendance, equipment management, etc.

## Future Plans

- **Authentication & Authorization**: Secure endpoints with Spring Security (JWT tokens or OAuth).
- **Microservices**: Break the application into smaller microservices for better scalability.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Deploy to AWS, using RDS for the database and S3 for file storage.
- **Mobile App Integration**: Develop a mobile app that connects to this backend.
